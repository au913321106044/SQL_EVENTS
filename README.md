Description
The Event Ticketing System is a SQL-based project designed to manage events, customers, tickets, and payments efficiently. It allows users to book and track event tickets while demonstrating SQL concepts such as joins, aggregate functions, and logical operations using MySQL for effective database management and reporting.

 Introduction

An Event Ticketing System is a database-driven application designed to manage and automate the process of booking, reserving, and selling tickets for various events such as concerts, seminars, festivals, conferences, and exhibitions.
It eliminates manual ticket handling and ensures efficient coordination between event organizers, customers, and the ticketing platform.
This project demonstrates the use of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts such as Normalization, Joins, Subqueries, Views, Triggers, and Stored Procedures to manage ticketing operations effectively.

Objective of the Project

The main objective of the Event Ticketing System is to:
Maintain and organize event-related data in a structured form.
Manage ticket availability, reservations, and sales efficiently.
Prevent overbooking by automatically updating ticket counts.
Generate real-time sales and revenue reports.
Demonstrate advanced SQL features like triggers, views, and stored procedures.

3. Scope of the Project

The system can be used for:
Concerts and Festivals
Sports Events
Theatre and Cinema
Seminars and Conferences
College Cultural Events
It can easily be extended to include features such as online payments, barcode-based ticket validation, and customer feedback systems.

4. System Overview

The Event Ticketing System consists of several main modules:
Event Management – stores and manages information about all events, including event name, venue, date, and total tickets.
Customer Management – maintains customer details such as name, email, and contact information.
Ticket Management – records ticket status (Available, Reserved, Sold) and connects tickets to specific events.
Reservation Management – tracks which customers have reserved tickets and when.

Sales Management – records completed purchases, calculates revenue, and triggers automatic updates to ticket availability.
